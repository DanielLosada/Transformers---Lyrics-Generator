## 1. Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
Lyrics generation, the task of automatically generating song lyrics using deep learning techniques, has gained significant attention in recent years. With the advancements in natural language processing and deep learning, generating creative and coherent lyrics has become an intriguing but still a challenging task. This project aims to explore and address these challenges by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models and fine-tuning them on suitable datasets. 

By analyzing the generated lyrics' quality, we can gain insights into the potential and limitations of deep learning models in the realm of lyrics generation.

### 1.1 Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
Our motivation for this project is driven by two main factors: the desire to explore cutting-edge technologies and the fascination with the creative possibilities of lyrics generation. LLMs have shown impressive abilities in understanding and generating human-like text. By working on lyrics generation, we aim to dive deeper into these technologies and understand their potential for creative text generation.

## 2. Data Set <a name="dataset"></a>
There are three primary methods for acquiring a dataset:

1. Extracting data from websites using tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.
2. Utilizing the Genius API to gather data.
3. Accessing pre-existing datasets from platforms like Kaggle or other similar sources.

After trying all of them, we have opted for using datasets from Kaggle.
We have chosen the following 2 datasets:
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mervedin/genius-lyrics
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neisse/scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">To top</a></p>

## 3. Working Environment <a name="working_env"></a>
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is used as the main framework.
We started out in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as it was fast and easy for us to access. Then we passed on to training locally and via a VM instance on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) but we had a problem with access to GPUs on Google Cloud therefore we couldn't complete our training there. To view the results we used [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site).

## 4. General Architecture and implementation <a name="architecture"></a>
The development of advanced language models has brought significant changes to tasks like lyrics generation in natural language processing. These models, based on transformer architectures, have shown impressive skills in understanding and creating meaningful text that makes sense in different contexts. GPT, one of these models, has received a lot of attention because of its outstanding performance and flexibility. We have chosen to utilize GPT-2, which is the most recent version of the GPT models accessible on the Hugging Face platform.

GPT-2 consists of solely stacked decoder blocks from the transformer architecture. This architecture allows GPT-2 to effectively capture the relationships between words and generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

The GPT-2 model was trained on a large corpus of text data that consisted of approximately 40 gigabytes of text (around 8 million tokens). The model has 1.5 billion parameters.

<p align="left">
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ywV_aKn0qnO4IR9Bxmwqxw2Gt7lyehcg">
    <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ywV_aKn0qnO4IR9Bxmwqxw2Gt7lyehcg" alt="Image" style="width: 800px; height: auto; display: inline-block;" title="Image" />
  </a>
</p>

For implementation we used the Hugging Face Transformers library. We initialized the language model using AutoModelForCausalLM. For tokenizing we utilized the AutoTokenizer class from the transformers library, which automatically selects the tokenizer associated with the specific pre-trained model you are using, ensuring compatibility between the model and tokenizer. 

For training we created a data collator specifically for language modeling training using the DataCollatorForLanguageModeling class from the transformers library. The data collator is responsible for batching and preparing the input data during training.
Then we instantiated the Trainer object from the same library with the model, training arguments, and datasets.
The trainer trains the model using the trainer.train() method.

## 5. Preprocessing the data set <a name="dataset_preprocess"></a>
Overall, the preprocessing steps involve:

* extracting the dataset
* removing non-English authors to ensure language consistency
* cleaning and formatting the lyrics data to eliminate unwanted artifacts
* tokenizing the datasets for further processing, setting a maximum context length (maximum context length for GPT-2 model is 1024 tokens but we use 512 due to limitations in computational resources)

## 6. Results <a name="results"></a>
    
### 6.1 Experiment 1: Single-artist training and generation with same prompt <a name="experiment_1"></a>


**A. Training on Genius Lyrics dataset** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mervedin/genius-lyrics

Experiment setup: We fine-tuned GPT-2 on 100 lyrics by a single artist. We used local environment for training. For generatiion we use the same input prompt for all the artist tested. We use a small input prompt to not condition the model too much with it. We want to see how it behaves with a small input prompt for each artist tested. We trained and tested on 6 artists: 50 Cent, Taylor Swift, The Beatles, Queen, Justin Bieber, and Imagine Dragons. 

Hypothesis: Even though we only use 100 songs, the model should be able to fit the vocabulary and style of each one of them, and continue the input prompt with the artist style.

Resuts: 
The full results can be seen in the W&B report. #TODO: add link to the "You are" report. Here we are going to show some examples of the results obtained.
* Input prompt: "You are"
    * Artist: 50 Cent
     ```
    I'm not a person with money, I don't care if you gave me stuff, I don't care if you went out and stolen
    I'm not a person with feelings, I'm a person that likes to drink
    There's no way you were gonna give me crap
     ```

     ```
    I'm not giving a fuckin' man a fuck, I ain't get no respect
    But I did make my girl want sex, boy
     
     ```
    * Artist: Taylor Swift
    ```
    And I'm still crying now, when I see you in that restaurant
    There's a new tattoo in my yard
    And all of a sudden I'm feeling so bad about the way you look
    Now I think we are at peace
    ```

    ```
    Never think you're alone
    Never feel like you're alone
    You know I love you
    You know I've loved you
    ```
    * Artist: The Beatles

    ```
    Happy Independence Day
    Sing and dance to peace
    Love and happiness are your only hope
    Hear your friend sing, "The World Won't Stop Talking"
    ```

    On this examples of the results obtained, we can see how on 50 Cent, the model understood that his lyrics have more agressive tone, talks about drugs, sex, crime, etc. When going to Taylor Swift, the style changes completely. Now talks way more about feelings and love, and it's really delicate with the words used. When generating The Beatles, we can see some claim pro peace.

    Conclusions:
    We can conclude, that the Hypothesis was correct, not only changes the tone and vocabulary used to one that the artist would use, also change the topic of the lyrics. We can see that the model is able to fit the vocabulary and style of each artist, and continue the input prompt with the artist style. We can see the same behaviour with the other artists tested and with other inputs. To see another input go to the W&B report. #TODO: add link to the "I will" report.

### 6.2 Experiment 2: Specific genre training and generation with same prompt <a name="experiment_2"></a>

Results:
* Input prompt: "You are"
    * Genre: Reggae
    ```
    Oh will your mercy please, lord!
    But as God forgive us,
    We will be free, and free will be good Come take a walk and take your shoes off.
    ```

    ```
    Oh will your mercy please, lord!


Experiment setup: Now we are training on even bigger amounts of data - a set of lyrics of a certain genre (determined by an argument specified in argparse) containing of up to a 1000 of songs (Lyrics from 79 musical genres dataset) . Training is done in a local environment or via a Google Cloud VM instance (CPU only, we didn't have GPUs available). 
We only choose artists with popularity >5 since we believe that with more popular artists the chances of getting better quality lyrics are higher since their lyrics have been checked and validated by many users. Some artists´songs also belong to several genres, we only take into account those that have songs of only one genre to avoid genre mixup in our generated lyrics.

Hypothesis: We expect the training to be more productive and a significant improvement in the quality of generated lyrics.

Results and conclusions: We observe a decrease in overfitting issues, indicating a better generalization capability of the model. The generated lyrics showed reasonable quality and coherence, making more sense in the context of the chosen genre.
At this stage is became more difficult to complete training with the computational resources we had. Training was taking a longer time.

### 6.3 Experiment 3: Conditional lyrics generation with the same prompt <a name="experiment_3"></a>

Experiment setup: Training with a full dataset to generate song lyrics similar to those of a specific artist. The dataset is Genius lyrics, and the artist and the prompt are determined by the arguments specified in argparse. Similarly to experiment 1, we use the same prompt for all the artists. Here we trained and tested on 5 artists: 50 Cent, Taylor Swift, Queen, Justin Bieber, and The Notorious B.I.G.. 

Hypothesis: Since we use the complete dataset, on more data the model should be even better fitted for lyrics generation in general. As for lyrics specific to a particular artist, though the model is fed with lyrics of a lot of different artists, we expect it to keep to the style and vocabulary of the chosen artist.

Results: Here you can find some extracts of results that prove the hypothesis.

* Input prompt: "I will"
  
    * Artist: Taylor Swift
     ```
    On top of the world
    And then you'll get used to it
    When my light shines on the stars
    You'll still smell them the same burning from day to day
    I'll send you in
    On top of the world
    And then you'll get used to it
    When it's time to shine
     ```
    * Artist: Justin Bieber
     ```
    Come on D'you know all that I hold dear
    I'll take a trip with you, baby girl, I will see you in the mirror
    You know you are a big part of who I am
     ```
     ```
     Let's go, D'you know all that I hold dear
     I'll take it
     Marry you babe, please, you know I'ma hold onto you all your life
     (Oh-Oh!)
     We'll make love, girl(Yeah)
     It's been a long time since we last met
     Still on the edge of love, we're sure it's real
     ```
    * Artist: The Notorious B.I.G.
     ```
     I'm not looking for drama anymore
     There's a good reason I'm here
     But then you find your way
     And I try, but I don't show 'em
     She don't wanna hear it
     So it's gotta be slow
     I mean, I am the slowest motherfucker I knew

Conclusions: We can see that our results are similar to those of experiment 1, the lyrics stick to the style and the language of the chosen artist.
However, we note that there is still quite a bit of room for improvement in terms of coherence of the lyrics. We expected the results to be better in that sense.
The main issue is the lack of computational resources to increase the dataset and/or further fine-tune the parameters.

Here you can find mode examples with a different prompt: https://wandb.ai//upcproject/Lyrics%20Generator/reports/Multiple-artists-generated-lyrics-prompt-You-are---Vmlldzo0OTEyNzQ3?accessToken=g3lev2vf26vg7jsg20q6a2qgmmq8faqczopt89e99f2gp1xprrjaznx87e3llqxk

The training is quite stable with gradually decresing training loss and evaluation loss.

### 6.4 Experiment 4: Performance evaluation <a name="experiment_4"></a>

**A. BLEU SCORE**

Experiment setup: In our evaluation process, we conduct a distinct training session. During evaluation, we provide the model with song lyrics as a prompt and remove the final 20 words from each song. The model generates the missing portion, and we utilize the BLEU score to assess the similarity between the generated lyrics and the truncated reference lyrics. By afterwards comparing the BLEU scores obtained from the model fine-tuned on our dataset and the model without fine-tuning, we can evaluate the quality of the generated lyrics.

Hypothesis: BLEU score should be higher in fine-tuned model output.

Results and conclusions : BLEU score in indeed higher in lyrics generated by the fine-tuned model, it suggests that the fine-tuned model has improved in generating lyrics that are more similar to the reference lyrics.
However, it's important to note that BLEU scores alone do not provide a complete assessment of the quality of the generated lyrics. BLEU primarily measures the overlap in n-grams and may not capture aspects such as creativity, coherence, or semantic understanding. Therefore, it's recommended to complement BLEU scores with other evaluation methods, including human evaluation, to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the fine-tuned model's performance in generating high-quality lyrics.

**A. PERPLEXITY**

Experiment setup: We also measure perplexity (Perplexity = 2^(- (1 / N) * Σ(log2(p(w_i))))). A lower perplexity value indicates that the model is more confident and has a better understanding of the data. Conversely, a higher perplexity value suggests that the model is less certain and has a harder time predicting the data. We compare the perplexity obtained from raw GPT-2 model and the GPT-2-based model fine-tuned on our dataset.

Hypothesis: Perplexity should be lower in fine-tuned model output.

Results and conclusions : Our hypothesis is confirmed and we get lower values of perplexity in fine-tuned model output. However, perplexity alone can not be used to measure the performance of the Lyrics generator. Perplexity measures the model's ability to predict the next word based on the context but it doesn't capture the semantic coherence or meaningfulness of the generated lyrics. A model could have low perplexity but still produce nonsensical or incoherent lyrics. In addition, perplexity can not measure creativity.

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">To top</a></p>

### 6.5 Experiment 5: T5 model <a name="experiment_5"></a>
T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) is a transformer-based language model developed by Google Research. Unlike GPT-2, which is primarily designed for autoregressive language generation, T5 follows a "text-to-text" framework. Instead of generating lyrics word by word like GPT-2, T5 is trained to map an input text prompt to an output text sequence.
T5 was trained on a large and diverse collection of publicly available text data from the internet. The specific details regarding the exact number of data, tokens, and parameters used for training T5 have not been disclosed publicly by Google Research. However, it is known to be a large-scale model with billions of parameters.

<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1VdnrzFDsd-yFs99O8ujCDiWPRzJFdoow" align="left">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1VdnrzFDsd-yFs99O8ujCDiWPRzJFdoow" alt="Image" style="width: auto; max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;" title="Image" />
</a>

Unfortunately due to the lack of time we could not conduct the T5 experiment.

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">To top</a></p>

## 7. Conclusions <a name="conclusions"></a>
Model Performance: The performance of the lyrics generator heavily depends on the size and quality of the dataset used for fine-tuning. When fine-tuning the model on a small dataset, the generated lyrics may lack coherence, structure, and meaningfulness. On the other hand, fine-tuning the model on a larger and more diverse dataset tends to produce more coherent and contextually relevant lyrics.

Training time and hardware requirements: Fine-tuning the GPT-2 or T5 model on a large dataset can be a computationally intensive task. It is essential to have access to sufficient computational power to train the model effectively.

Creativity: While the lyrics generator can produce very good outputs, it is important to note that the model will always lack true creativity and originality that a human songwriter could produce. However, it can serve as a valuable tool for generating initial ideas or providing inspiration to human songwriters.
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">To top</a></p>

## 8. Next Steps <a name="next_steps"></a>
After completing the project, several potential further steps for research and exploration can be proposed:

* Trying a model with different architecture (e.g. T5)
* Multilingual Lyrics Generation: Extend the project to support lyrics generation in multiple languages.
* Generation of lyrics with a proper song structure, including a title, chorus, verses and other sections.
* Multimodal lyrics generation: Extend the project to generate not only textual lyrics but also explore the generation of accompanying music or melodies.
* Deploying an application for lyrics generation
