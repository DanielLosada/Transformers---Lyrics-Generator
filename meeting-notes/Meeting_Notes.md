# Meeting notes 25/5/23

* We have created a common [repository](https://github.com/DanielLosada/Transformers---Lyrics-Generator) to start working on the lyrics generator project.

* We have included an initial conda setup that can be found in the main project's README.md.

* We will work using the following approach: checkout from [develop](https://github.com/DanielLosada/Transformers---Lyrics-Generator/tree/develop) branch and create our personal branches to avoid colliding. Then we will merg back our changes to develop. For instance:

```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b example-project-branch
```

* We will initally work on individual proposals based on already existent projects. Our aim will be to use these solutions to implement a lyrics generator draft.

* Each team member will choose a different reference project to explore alternative solutions. Later we will evaluate them and work on a common solution based on our experiences.

* Three datasets have been initially chosen to limitate scope: [genius-lyrics dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mervedin/genius-lyrics), [metrolyrics dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics) or [scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/neisse/scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres)

* This initial examples will be included in the following directory: ``examples/<team-member-name>``

* We will gather next weekend (3-4-5/6/23) to discuss our results and work on a common approach. We will notify our progress over the Slack channel.
